Write a python program called make_chocolate.py.

Given 3 positional arguments: the numbers of small bars (1 kilo each), big bars (5 kilos each), and goal kilos of chocolate, return the number of small bars to use if the goal chocolate can be done, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. Otherwise, print out "The goal chocolate cannot be done".


```
$ ./make_chocolate.py -h
